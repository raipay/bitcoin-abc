# Chronik

Chronik is an indexer built directly into the Bitcoin ABC node.

You can read about the reasoning behind this indexer in [this article by Mengerian](https://mengerian.medium.com/why-i-am-excited-about-the-ecash-chronik-project-1401b945eb21).

The code in this repository is for the integration into the node, which is currently unfinished. However, you can use these experimental versions:

1. Chronik via NNG interface (recommended, for now): https://github.com/raipay/chronik/
2. Experimental Chronik built into Bitcoin ABC (not recommended, but easier to set-up): https://github.com/raipay/bitcoin-abc/tree/chronik

You can also join the Chronik Work Group on Telegram if you have issues, contact Tobias Ruck to add you.
