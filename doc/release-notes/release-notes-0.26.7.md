# Bitcoin ABC 0.26.7 Release Notes

Bitcoin ABC version 0.26.7 is now available from:

  <https://download.bitcoinabc.org/0.26.7/>

This release includes the following features and fixes:
 - `getblockchaininfo` now returns a new `time` field, that provides the chain
   tip time.
 - Add a `-daemonwait` option to `bitcoind` to wait for initialization to complete
   before putting the process in the background. This allows the user or parent
   process to more easily know whether the daemon started successfully by observing
   the programâ€™s output or exit code.
 - The `savemempool` RPC now returns the path to the saved mempool in the `filename` field.
 - Bitcoin ABC now supports User-space, Statically Defined Tracing (USDT).
   For now only a few tracepoints are available, see [tracing.md](/doc/tracing.md) for more info.
 - Avalanche is now enabled by default. It is still possible to disable it by
   using `-avalanche=0` on the command line, or setting `avalanche=0` in the
   `bitcoin.conf` file.
